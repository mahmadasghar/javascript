// 1: Diffrence between let & var varible assignment
//      with let, you can't initialize another varible with same name in a let expression.
//      while you can do this with var.
// let someVariable = 78
// var anotherVariable = 57

// 2: Rules for naming varibles
//      i: name cannot start with a number
//          let 4des = 134
//      ii: name cannot contain any specical characters except for an underscore (_) (note: no space allowed as well)
                        //  let varible
