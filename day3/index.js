// Operators: 
    // Operators are special symbols that perform operations on the values
    // There are two categories of operators
    // i- Uniry Operators ii- Binary Operators

    // 1- Uniry Operators:
        // These are the operators that perform operation on only one value for example (++, --)

let aNumber = 5
let anotherNumber = 5

anotherNumber = anotherNumber + aNumber++

// Question: What will be the value of 'anotherNumber' after above operation?
// console.log('aNumber ', aNumber)
// console.log('anotherNumber', anotherNumber)

    // 2- Binary Operators:
        // These are the operators that perform operation on at least two values for example (+, -, *, /)
        // Binary Operators are of 3 types
        // i-Arithmatic operators ii-Logical Operators iii-Comparison Operators
            // 1- Arithmatic Operators
            // These are;
                // + (plus)
                // - (minus)
                // * (multiply)
                // / (divide)
                // % (modulas) (gives back the reminder)
                    console.log('Modulas Result: ', 123 % 9)
                // ** (exponent) (calculates the power of the number)
                    console.log('power 2 of 10: ', 10**2)
